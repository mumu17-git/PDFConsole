in Chrome.

Like many of you, I always thought of PDF as basically a benign
format, where the author lays out some text and graphics, and then the
PDF sits in front of the reader and doesn't do anything. I heard
offhand about vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader years ago, but didn't
think too much about why or how they might exist.

That _was_ why Adobe made PDF at first[^ps], but I think we've
established that it's not quite true anymore. The
[1,310-page PDF specification][spec] (actually a really clear and
interesting read) specifies a bizarre amount of functionality,
including:

[spec]: https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf

- [Embedded Flash][]
- [Audio][] and [video][] annotations
- [3D object][] annotations (!)
- [Web capture](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf#page=946) metadata
- [Custom math functions][] (including a [Turing-incomplete subset of
PostScript][])
- Rich text forms using [a subset of XHTML and CSS][]
- [File][] and [file-collection][] attachments

but most interestingly...

- [JavaScript scripting][], using a
  [completely different standard library from the browser one][acrobatjs]

[JavaScript scripting]: https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf#page=709
[acrobatjs]: https://wwwimages2.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/js_api_reference.pdf

Granted, most PDF readers (besides Adobe Reader) don't implement most
of this stuff. _But Chrome does implement JavaScript!_ If you open a
PDF file like this one in Chrome, it will run the scripts. I found
this fact out after following
[this blog post about how to make PDFs with JS](https://mariomalwareanalysis.blogspot.com/2012/02/how-to-embed-javascript-into-pdf.html).

There's a catch, though. Chrome only implements a _tiny_ subset of the
enormous Acrobat JavaScript API surface. The API implementation in
Chrome's PDFium reader mostly consists of
[stubs like these](https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/+/chromium/2557/fpdfsdk/src/javascript/Document.cpp#258):

```cpp
FX_BOOL Document::addAnnot(IJS_Context* cc,
                           const CJS_Parameters& params,
                           CJS_Value& vRet,
                           CFX_WideString& sError) {
  // Not supported.
  return TRUE;
}
FX_BOOL Document::addField(IJS_Context* cc,
                           const CJS_Parameters& params,
                           CJS_Value& vRet,
                           CFX_WideString& sError) {
  // Not supported.
  return TRUE;
}
FX_BOOL Document::exportAsText(IJS_Context* cc,
                               const CJS_Parameters& params,
                               CJS_Value& vRet,
                               CFX_WideString& sError) {
  // Unsafe, not supported.
  return TRUE;
}
```

And I understand their concern -- that custom Adobe JavaScript API has
an [absolutely gigantic surface area][]. Scripts can supposedly do
things like [make arbitrary database connections][],
[detect attached monitors][], [import external resources][], and
[manipulate 3D objects][].

[absolutely gigantic surface area]: https://wwwimages2.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/js_api_reference.pdf#page=3
[make arbitrary database connections]: https://wwwimages2.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/js_api_reference.pdf#page=36
[detect attached monitors]: https://wwwimages2.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/js_api_reference.pdf#page=537
[import external resources]: https://wwwimages2.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/js_api_reference.pdf#page=317
[manipulate 3D objects]: https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/js_3d_api_reference.pdf

So we have this strange situation in Chrome: we can do arbitrary
computation, but we have this weird, constrained API surface, where
it's annoying to do I/O and get data between the program and the
user.[^situation][^es6]

It might be possible to embed a C compiler into a PDF by compiling it
to JS with [Emscripten][], for example, but then your C compiler has to
take input through a plain-text form field and spit its output back
through a form field.

[Emscripten]: https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/


[^ps]: In fact, I got interested in PDF a couple weeks ago because of
[PostScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript); I'd been reading these random Don Hopkins posts about
[NeWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeWS), the system supposedly like
AJAX but done in the 80s on PostScript.

    Ironically, PDF was a
    [reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format#PostScript)
    to PostScript, which was too expressive (being a full
    programming language) and too hard to analyze and reason
    about. PDF remains a big improvement there, I think, but
    it's still funny how it's grown all these features.

    It's also really interesting: like any long-lived digital format
    (I have a thing for the FAT filesystem, personally), PDF is itself
    a kind of historical document. You can see generations of
    engineers, adding things that they needed in their time, while
    trying not to break anything already out there.

[^situation]: I'm not sure why Chrome even bothered to expose the JS
    runtime. They
    [took the PDF reader code from Foxit](https://plus.google.com/+FrancoisBeaufort/posts/9wwSiWDDKKP),
    so maybe Foxit had some particular client who relied on JavaScript
    form validation?

[^es6]: Chrome also uses the same runtime it does in the browser, even
    though it doesn't expose any browser APIs. That means you can use
    ES6 features like double-arrow functions and Proxies, as far as I
    can tell.

### pdfconsole

So what can we do with the API surface that Chrome gives us?

I'm sorry, by the way, that the collision detection is not great and
the game speed is inconsistent. (Not really the point, though!) I
ripped off most of the game from
[a tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_pdfconsole_game_pure_JavaScript).

The first user-visible I/O points I could find in Chrome's
implementation of the PDF API were in
[Field.cpp](https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/+/chromium/2524/fpdfsdk/src/javascript/Field.cpp).

You [can't set the fill color][SetFillColor] of a text field at
runtime, but you can [change its bounds rectangle][SetRect] and
[set its border style][SetBorderStyle]. You can't
[read the precise mouse position][mouseX], but you can set mouse-enter
and mouse-leave scripts on fields at PDF creation. And you can't add
fields at runtime: you're stuck with what you put in the PDF at
creation time.[^fortran]. I'm actually curious why they chose those
particular methods.

[SetFillColor]: https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/+/chromium/2524/fpdfsdk/src/javascript/Field.cpp#1631
[SetRect]: https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/+/chromium/2524/fpdfsdk/src/javascript/Field.cpp#2356
[SetBorderStyle]: https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/+/chromium/2524/fpdfsdk/src/javascript/Field.cpp#479
[mouseX]: https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/+/chromium/2524/fpdfsdk/src/javascript/Document.cpp#1107

So the PDF file is generated by a
[script](https://github.com/osnr/horrifying-pdf-experiments/blob/master/generate_pdfconsole.py)
which emits a bunch of text fields upfront, including game elements:

- Paddle
- Bricks
- Ball
- Score
- Lives

But we also do a few hacks here to get the game to work properly.

First, we emit a thin, long 'band' text field for each column of the
lower half of the screen. Some band gets a mouse-enter event whenever
you move your mouse along the x-axis, so the pdfconsole paddle can move
as you move your mouse.

And second, we emit a field called 'whole' which covers the whole top
half of the screen. Chrome doesn't expect the PDF display to change,
so if you move fields around in JS, you get pretty bad artifacts. This
'whole' field solves that problem when we toggle it on and off during
frame rendering. That trick seems to force Chrome to clean out the
artifacts.

Also, moving a field appears to discard its
[appearance stream](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf#page=612). The
fancy arbitrary PDF-graphics appearance you chose goes away, and it
gets replaced with a basic filled and bordered rectangle. So my game
objects generally rely on the
[simpler appearance characteristics dictionary](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf#page=642). At
the very least, a fill color specified there stays intact as a widget
moves.


[^fortran]: It's like some stereotype of programming in old-school
    FORTRAN. You have to declare all your variables upfront so the
    compiler can statically allocate them.

  exactly the right level of abstraction for this kind of work. A lot
  of libraries are too high-level and expose just graphics
  operators. Generating the PDF data yourself is possible but a little
  annoying, because you need to get the data structure formats and
  byte offsets right.
